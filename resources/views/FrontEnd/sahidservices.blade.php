                    Making a nation prosperous is possible only through its healthy citizens. The primary
                    responsibilities of any state include the extension of affordable, reliable and modern technology
                    based quality health service to the public. In the context of Nepal, the health service in the
                    government level hasn’t be reasonable, qualitative, sufficient and effective due to the geographical
                    diversity, uncontrolled population growth and the lack of proper management. On the other hand we
                    shouldn’t forget the bitter fact that the health service provided by the private health institutions
                    like hospital, nursing homes and polyclinics is very expensive and unreachable to the Nepali people
                    suffering from price hikes and poverty.
